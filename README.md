# 3D-UNet-Segmenation-for-Brain-Infarction
This is the code to develp a 3D UNet segmentation model to perform infarct lesion segmentation from T1 weighted brain MRI scan.
The input of the moel 3D overlapped patches of brain scan.
This code is inspired by https://github.com/96imranahmed/3D-Unet/blob/master/3D_unet.ipynb.
For more information of the model, please refer to our paper "Automated Segmentation of Infarct Lesions in T1-weighted MRI Scans
using Variational Mode Decomposition and Deep Learning".
